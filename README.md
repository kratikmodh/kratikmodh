# 👨‍💻 About Me

Hey there! 👋 I’m a **React Native Developer** with **5 years of experience** building secure, scalable, and production-ready mobile applications. I’ve worked across industries—from **health tech** and **agriculture** to **aviation** and **e-commerce**, including a **patented BLE-integrated app** now running at every airport in India 🇮🇳✈️. 

Recently, I’ve been expanding into backend development using **Node.js**, having contributed to a **MERN project with Razorpay integration** and deployed it via **AWS EC2**.

I thrive on leading teams, solving complex problems, and bridging the gap between hardware and software through BLE, native modules, and cutting-edge integrations.
